	The <b>2020 Comparison of Tools for the Analysis of Quantitative Formal Models</b> (<a href="../../index.html">QComp</a> 2020) will be part of <a href="http://isola-conference.org/isola2020/">ISoLA 2020</a>.
	It is the second <b>friendly competition</b> among verification and analysis tools for quantitative formal models.
	Based on a <a href="benchmarks.html">curated subset of benchmarks</a> from the <a href="../../benchmarks/index.html">Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set</a>, QComp will compare the performance, versatility, and usability of the participating tools.
</p>
<p>
	QComp 2020 is a flexible and friendly event.
	There is no global scoring or ranking of tools.
	Instead, we collect data and publish comparison tables, diagrams, and text about the performance, versatility, and usability of the participating tools.
	We analyse and highlight every tool's strengths and tradeoffs.
	The entire performance evaluation and report-writing process will be performed in close collaboration with the participants to quickly include feedback and resolve any setup errors or misunderstandings early.
	We expect all participants to co-author the competition report.
</p>

</ul>
<p>
	The organisers will make the tool packaging instructions available to the participants around February 24.
	The purpose of the re-evaluation phase in May is to allow participants to fix bugs in their tools that were not discovered in their own testing prior to the original tool submission.
	It is not intended for significant changes with the aim of improving the tools' performance.
</p>


<h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>
<p>
	Every tool that solves a significant subset of the <a href="benchmarks.html">competition benchmarks</a> is welcome, even if it may not support all model types, the JANI format, or all included kinds of properties.
	Every participating tool must be associated to exactly one participant (with exceptions), who we expect to co-author the competition report.
	A participant may participate with multiple tools, or multiple variants (e.g. analysis engines) of the same tool.
	The currently registered participants are:

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>
	The evaluation of performance, versatility, and usability will be performed by the organisers.
</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>
	All tools will be evaluated on a standard desktop machine running an up-to-date 64-bit version of Ubuntu Linux 18.04.
	We plan to use the same machine with an Intel Core i7-920 CPU and 12 GB of RAM that was previously used for <a href="../2019/index.html">QComp 2019</a>.
	We will use a timeout of 30 minutes per model and tool.
	The organisers will make the benchmarking scripts available to participants for testing.
	Participants provide a tool package, installation instructions, and scripts that generate command lines to run the <a href="benchmarks.html">selected benchmarks</a> and extract the tool's results.
	We will not directly evaluate memory usage, but note that the amount of RAM available in the central server is not high.
	Thus memory usage will be evaluated indirectly by considering for which (large) models a tool fails due to an out-of-memory situation.
</p>

<h3>Performance Evaluation Tracks</h3>
<p>
	Due to the different types of correctness guarantees on results provided by different analysis methods, we will compare tools in three different tracks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>correct results</b>:
		tools/algorithms that unconditionally guarantee a difference of zero between the tool's result and the correct value.
		These tools could e.g. use techniques based on parametric model checking, state elimination with rational arithmetic, or rational search.
		Tools return a reduced fraction (as a string) that must be equal to the reference result.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>floating-point correct results</b>:
		tools/algorithms that unconditionally guarantee a difference of zero between the tool's result and the correct value modulo imprecisions of floating-point arithmetic.
		These tools could e.g. use techniques based on state elimination with floating-point arithmetic.
		We check whether the results provided by tools are within a relative error of ± 1e-14 compared to the reference results.
		Tools that participate in the <i>correct results</i> track should participate in this track, too.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>ε-correct results</b>:
		tools/algorithms that unconditionally guarantee an a priori fixed bound on the difference between the tool's result and the correct value.
		They must provide results within a relative error of ± 1e-6 compared to the reference results.
		These tools typically use sound iterative algorithms with floating-point arithmetic like interval iteration.
		Tools that participate in the <i>floating-point correct results</i> track should participate in this track, too.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>probably ε-correct results</b>:
		tools/algorithms that guarantee an a priori fixed bound on the difference between the tool's result and the correct value with a certain probability.
		They must provide results within a relative error of ± 5e-2 compared to the reference results with probability 0.95.
		These tools typically use simulation-based approaches such as statistical model checking.
		Tools that participate in the <i>ε-correct results</i> track should participate in this track, too.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>often ε-correct results</b>:
		tools/algorithms that do not guarantee any a priori fixed bound on the difference between the tool's result and the correct value, but often deliver results that meet such a bound.
		These tools typically use unsound iterative algorithms like standard value iteration, or compute over- or underapproximations.
		Tools that participate in the <i>probably ε-correct results</i> track should participate in this track, too.
		We will perform two evaluations in this track:
		<ul>
			<li>one in which we report runtime and the number of incorrect results, for a relative error of ± 1e-3, and</li>
			<li>one where we only report the error that the tool achieved within a 10-minute timeout.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tool Parameters</h3>
<p>
	All tools will be evaluated in two settings:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		once with <b>default parameters</b> that must be the same for all benchmark instances (but that can differ between tracks), and
	</li>
	<li>
		once with <b>tweaked parameters</b> that may additionally take the following criteria, which are given to the script that generates the command lines, into account:
		<ul>
			<li>the type of the model (DTMC, CTMC, ...),</li>
			<li>the type of the property (unbounded probabilistic reachability, unbounded expected reward, ...), and</li>
			<li>an indication of the expected size of the state space (e.g. less than 100000 states, less than 1 million states, ...).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Correctness of Results</h3>
<p>
	For quantitative benchmarks, it is often not clear what the true, correct numeric result for a property is.
	This is due to most tools that scale to large models using inexact floating-point arithmetic, and because any result may be affected by bugs in whatever "reference" tool is used.
	At the same time, it does not make sense to report performance data when a tool provides an incorrect result as this may be due to an error that drastically reduces or increases the analysis time.
	For this reason, QComp adopts the following pragmatic approach to evaluate the correctness of the results produced by the participating tools:
	The organisers have used the most trustworthy analysis approach available (e.g. an exact-arithmetic solver for small and a model checker using a sound iterative numerical method for large models) to produce <i>reference results</i> for all selected models.
	Participants may use any other tool to try to refute the correctness of any of those reference results.
	If this happens, all participants will discuss and agree on a new reference result, or decide to exclude the affected benchmark.
	During the performance evaluation phase, every result that does not agree with the reference result up to the desired precision will be considered as incorrect.
	The number of incorrect results produced by a tool will be listed in the competition report.
</p>

<h3>Versatility and Usability</h3>
<p>
	As part of the competition report, we will also evaluate the versatility and usability of all participating tools.
	Versatility is determined by the types and sizes of models that the tool is able to successfully analyse in the performance evaluation.
	Usability is the quality of the tool's documentation (online, or provided as help text or messages within the tool), the availability of an easy-to-use graphical interface, how involved the installation process is, what platforms the tool runs on, whether it provides sensible default parameter settings, and so on.
	The usability evaluation will follow clearly defined criteria that will be agreed upon among the participants before the performance evaluation starts.
</p>


<h2 id="ltl">Linear Temporal Logic</h2>
<p>
	Several participants of <a href="../2019/index.html">QComp 2019</a> expressed an interest in comparing their tools' performance with respect to computing the probabilities of formulas in linear temporal logic (LTL).
	QComp 2020 will include such an evaluation if it includes tools from at least three participants, and those participants agree on a set of LTL benchmark instances by the tool package submission deadline.
	These benchmarks have to be available in JANI format, and eventually be added to the <a href="../../benchmarks/index.html">Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set</a>.
	The organisers will help coordinate such an effort and perform the LTL performance evaluation.
