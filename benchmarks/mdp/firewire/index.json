	"description": "This model is part of the PRISM Benchmark Suite [1] and concerns the Tree Identify Protocol of the IEEE 1394 High Performance Serial Bus, called ``FireWire''. The 1394 High Performance serial bus is used to transport video and audio signals within a network of multimedia devices. It is modeled as a leader election protocol which takes place after a bus reset in the network, that is, when a node is added or removed from the network. After such a reset all nodes in the network have equal status, and know only to which nodes they are directly connected. A leader needs to be chosen to act as the manager of the bus for subsequent phases of IEEE 1394. This is done by the nodes communicating ``be my parent'' messages, starting from the leaf nodes. The protocol is designed for use on connected networks and will correctly elect a leader if the network is acyclic. We consider probabilistic timed automata models of the root contention part of the tree identify protocol, which are based on probabilistic I/O automata models presented in [0]. `delayÂ´ is the maximum wire transmission delay in nano seconds. This models the distance between the two nodes, i.e. the length of the connecting wires. A delay of 360ns represents the assumption that the nodes are separated by a distance close to the maximum required for the correctness of the protocol. A delay of 30ns corresponds more closely to the maximum separation of nodes specified in the actual IEEE standard. See [2] for more details",
