	The <b>Fourth Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication of Research Results</b> (RRRR 2025) is part of <a href="https://etaps.org/2025/">ETAPS 2025</a> in Hamilton, Canada.
	It will take place on May 3, 2025, as part of the <a href="https://etaps.org/2025/sat-events/">ETAPS workshops</a>.
	RRRR provides a forum to present and discuss novel approaches to foster reproducibility of research results, and replication studies of existing work, in the broad area of formal methods and software engineering research.
	Its goal is to spread the word on best practices, and reward the work invested in replicating results.
</p>
<p>
	Where reproducible research can be independently confirmed by third parties using artifacts provided by the original authors, replicating a result means to independently obtain it using new measurements, data, or implementations.
	RRRR will improve the knowledge transfer between the many separate initiatives – like <a href="https://tacas.info/artifacts.php">artifact evaluations</a> and <a href="https://tacas.info/toolympics2023.php">tool competitions</a> – that today support reproducibility, and provide a venue to formally publish replication studies, recognising their immense benefit to the scientific community and the hard work involved.
</p>


<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>
	The goal of the RRRR workshop is to provide a venue for lively and constructive in-person discussions and knowledge exchange.
	Submissions should be related to research in the broad area of formal methods and software engineering.
	Submissions are welcome in, but not limited to, the following topics on reproducibility and replication:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Studies of reproducibility or replication trends in a formal methods or software engineering research area.</li>
	<li>Presentations of novel developments in, or retrospective studies on, reproducibility initiatives such as artifact evaluations.</li>
	<li>Reports on successful or failed attempts at reproducing or replicating earlier research results.</li>
	<li>Presentations of replication aspects within separate research papers, student thesis projects, and similar work.</li>
	<li>Tools and methods to support reproducibility and replication of research results.</li>
	<li>Any other topic related to reproducibility and replication; if in doubt, please contact the organizers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We in particular encourage authors of papers accepted at the main ETAPS conferences to present the reproducibility- and replication-related aspects of their work at RRRR.
	We also plan a special session on the topic of artifact evaluation, with reports by the chairs of the ETAPS 2025 artifact evaluation committees.
</p>


<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>
<p>
	Submissions are handled via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rrrr2025">EasyChair</a>.
	All accepted submissions will be informally published via the RRRR website.
	RRRR accepts presentation abstracts (1-2 pages in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS style</a> including references) as well as short papers (around 6 pages in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">LNCS style</a> plus references).
	The page limits are flexible.
	Authors of all accepted submissions will present their work at the workshop (in person).
</p>

<h3>Special Issue in STTT</h3>
<p>
	We plan to invite authors of accepted papers/abstracts to submit an extended/full version of their work to a special issue in the <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/10009">International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer</a> (STTT).
	All journal submissions will undergo a full reviewing process and are expected to be accompanied by an artifact where applicable.
</p>


<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>
	All dates are in 2025 and all deadlines are "anywhere on Earth" (UTC-12).
	The timeline may be adjusted if necessary so that the notification happens before the ETAPS 2025 early registration deadline.
	The organisers would appreciate an early informal indication, via <script type="text/javascript">WriteMailLinkHtml('n.etnewtu@snnamtrah.a:otliaml', 'email');</script>, of the intention to submit to RRRR 2025.
